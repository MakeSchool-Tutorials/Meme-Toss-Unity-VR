If you followed along with the video tutorial, you may have noticed we used a lot of static variables. THIS IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE! Since static variables can be referenced from anywhere and are not reset each scene, it's easy to lose track of code affecting them in larger projects, leading to large headaches. If you did the video tutorial and used static variables, take time right now to refactor your code so that you use normal variables and direct references.
