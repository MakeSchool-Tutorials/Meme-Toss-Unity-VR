Let's make Scene transitions less jarring.

>[action]
If you haven't already, implement the Scene transition that occurs when you have gone through enough Balls.  This can be a new Level, or it can just be an empty Scene.

>[action]
>Create a screen fade effect that happens in between scenes, so as to make it feel less-jarring.

Now you have a fairly feature-complete game!
